Game2048 is a number puzzle game based on the Android platform, where players need to merge identical number tiles through sliding operations, with the ultimate goal of creating the number 2048. This project is developed using the Java language, integrated with the Android SDK, to implement a complete 2048 game application.

Application Module Composition
- AnimationManager: Manages animations within the game, including transitions and movements of game elements.
- Card: Represents the logic and state of a game card, including its value and position.
- GameLogic: Contains the core logic and rules of the 2048 game, managing the game state, moves, and win/loss conditions.
- GameView: Handles the graphical user interface, rendering the game board, and interacting with user inputs.
- MainActivity: The main entry point of the application, initializing the game and handling the primary activity lifecycle.
- XML Resource Files: Define the layout, colors, strings, and styles used throughout the application.

Algorithm Description
- The algorithm description for each module in the project details the main activity流程, animation management, card logic, and the execution flow of game logic. Flowcharts and class diagrams are used to clearly demonstrate the initialization of the game, handling of user inputs, execution of game logic, updating of game state, and handling of game over scenarios.

System Class Description
- MainActivity: Initializes the main activity, sets up UI components, reads the highest score, and sets listeners for game interaction buttons.
- GameView: A custom view class used to display and manage the game grid, handle user swipe actions, and interact with GameLogic and AnimationManager.
- GameLogic: Manages the core game logic, including the movement and merging of cards, as well as checking the game state.
- Card: Represents each card in the game, managing the card's number and appearance, including color and size.
- AnimationManager: Manages and executes animations for cards, including animations for card creation and merging effects.

Test Data and Operation Process
- The project documentation provides system data operation processes and manual testing steps to ensure that the game initialization, user input handling, game logic execution, game state updating, and game over handling all work as expected.

Performance Evaluation
- The system's operational efficiency is evaluated using the Android Studio Profiler, including key performance metrics such as response time, memory usage, and processing speed.
